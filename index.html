                        <p>This year the Interschool Debate Competition was held at St.Xaviers School. There were 24 different schools participating. The competition was held for a week. Food and accommodation were arranged at school canteen. All the participants were extraordinarily skilled.One could actually see the future leaders in the contestants. The decisions of the judges were final. There were no foul plays. This year St.Xaviers School won the first prize and much to our amazement two of the best speakers were from St.Xaviers School.All the participants were students with equal calibre and potential but in the end, some stood out shining brighter than the others. The topic for the final competition was " the increasing number of old age homes in India ". There were so many notable points presented by each team but the point presented by the winning team was the game-changer.
